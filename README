LongoMatch is a video analysis tool oriented to sports and coaches, to assist them on making game video analysis. It simplifies video analysis by providing a set of intuitive tools to tag, review and edit the most important plays of the game. It allows to group plays by categories and adjust the lead and lag time of each play frame by frame through a timeline. It also has support for playlists, an easy way to create presentations with plays from different games and provides a video editor to create new videos from your favorite plays. Even if primary focused to sports, LongoMatch can be used for any task that requires tagging and reviewing segments of a video file, and can be applied to fields like cinema, medics or conferences

********************************************
Development Environment for OS X and Windows
********************************************

LongoMatch has a strong dependency on GStreamer, GTK+ and Mono, and the lack of a good packages
manager for Free Software applications on Windows and OS X makes it hard to depend on external installers.
In these platforms all the dependencies must be built from scratch, using cerbero's build system.
To setup your system you will need to install some external dependencie for the build system, depending
on your target Operating System:

  * Install the build depdendencies as explained in "Build requirements" here:
    http://docs.gstreamer.com/display/GstSDK/Building+from+source+using+Cerbero
  * On Windows, install Mono 3.2.3:
    http://download.mono-project.com/archive/3.2.3/windows-installer/mono-3.2.3-gtksharp-2.12.11-win32-0.exe

Compiling LongoMatch
====================

  * Clone cerbero's build system if you haven't done it before in the previous steps:
    $ mkdir ~/git/
    $ cd ~/git
    $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer-sdk/cerbero
  * Clone in a subdirectory cerbero-extras repository:
    $ cd ~/git/cerbero/
    $ git clone git@github.com:ylatuya/cerbero-extras.git
  * Bootstrap te build system:
    $ ./cerbero-uninstalled -c cerbero-extras/longomatch.cbc bootstrap
  * Package longomatch:
    $ ./cerbero-uninstalled -c cerbero-extras/longomatch.cbc package longomatch

And wait patiently until the build completes. It can takes from a couple of hours in Linux/OS X to a full day in Windows
