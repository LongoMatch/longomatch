It simplifies video analisys by providing a set of intuitive tools to tag, review and edit the most importants plays of the game. It allows to group plays by categories and adjust the lead and lag time of each play frame by frame through a timeline. It also has support for playlists, an easy way to create presentations with plays from different games and provides a video editor to create new videos from your favorite plays.

Windows Development Environment
*******************************

Getting the external dependencies
=================================

LongoMatch has a strong dependency on GStreamer, GTK+ and Mono, and the lack of a good packages
manager for Free Software applications on Windows makes it hard to depend on external installers,
such as the ones provided by Gtk+ or Mono. For GStreamer the situation is even worst, as there were
no installer available until GStreamer WinBuilds appeared, project started by the LongoMatch team.
Since it's very hrad to control which versions are installed in the users' machine and this part is
critical, at least on the GStreamer side, for the stability of LongoMatch, the external dependencies
need to be packaged in the installer for a fine-grained control of all them.

Gtk
---
  * Download the Gtk+ bundle for the verion 2.16 and install it in c:\gtk:
    http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/gtk+/2.16/gtk+-bundle_2.16.6-20100912_win32.zip

Mono
----
  * Download Mono 2.6.7 and install it in c:\mono:
    http://ftp.novell.com/pub/mono/archive/2.6.7/windows-installer/2/mono-2.6.7-gtksharp-2.12.10-win32-2.exe

GStreamer
--------
  * Download the latest gstreamer version and the SDK available from:
    http://code.google.com/p/ossbuild/
  * Create a folder named c:\gstreamer
  * Copy c:\Program Files\OSSBuild\GStreamer\$VERSION\* to c:\gstreamer
  * Copy c:\Program Files\OSSBuild\GStreamer\$VERSION\sdk\include to c:\gstreamer\include

Getting the build environment (MSYS/MinGW)
==========================================

  * Download from ossbuild the MSYS/MinGW environment with all the compiler tools:
    http://code.google.com/p/ossbuild/downloads/detail?name=msys_v11.7z&can=2&q=
  * Install Python 2.6
  * Instal git for windows from:
    http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/

Compiling LongoMatch
====================

  * Fetch the sources
    $ git clone git://git.gnome.org/longomatch /c/longomatch
  * Open a MSYS terminal (c:\msys\msys.bat)
  * Inside the terminal run:
    $ cd /c/longomatch/win32
    $ python deploy_win32.py
  * This will create a deployment folder in win32/dist with all the dependecies
  * Compile LongoMatch:
    $ make -f Makefile.win32 clean
    $ make -f Makefile.win32
    $ make -f Makefile.win32 install
  * LongoMatch is now compiled and ready to be distributed in the folder win32/dist/
