Description: Sports video analysis software
 Sports video analysis tool for coaches and sports scientists,
 to assist them on making games video analysis. It simplifies
 video analysis by providing a set of intuitive tools to tag,
 review and edit the most importants plays of the game. It 
 allows to group plays by categories and adjust the lead and
 lag time of each play frame by frame through a timeline. It
 also has support for playlists, an easy way to create
 presentations with plays from different games and provides
 a video editor to render new videos with your favorite plays.
 Even if it is primary focused to sports, LongoMatch can be used
 for any task that requires tagging and reviewing segments of a
 video file, and can be applied to fields like cinema, medics or
 conferences.
